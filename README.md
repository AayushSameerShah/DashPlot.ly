# DashPlot.ly
This repository includes my jupyter notebooks and data which I have created while learning Dash and Plotly.

### How to Read?
I have tried as much to structure the repository as readable as possible. The topics are devided into the folders with the respective names. You can take the information rightaway as you open it.

### Who is this for?
This is for me. I mean the language that I have chosen is pointing to me. Because I have created for learning purposes, I have tried to make things so clear and compact that I can visit to 
some topic later and find it faster.

Please use it as a reference and review about my style if possible, because I love markdown in jupyter, I have used it a lot (except here, I don't know what to include more than `###`)

Thanks!
