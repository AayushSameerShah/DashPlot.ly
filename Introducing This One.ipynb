    "I am really excited to take this course. Because after a long time (**Google Data Analtyics** - 3.5 months) I wanted to keep learning faster. I had a couple of courses enrolled on Coursera, I tried one of **AWS ML** and got the certificate, but... that *wasn't* one that I thought it would be. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then again, I took **Google Cloud for Azure professional**, haha by any means, I am not an Azure professional *now*, but still to learn, **I took it**. But after *3 days*, it looked like I am wasting my time. *I left* that. Nothing was going inside my mind. Then took another one called **Aruba Networking basics**. It was *shitty* as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "I started feeling that I need not to learn about ML or some kind of technical stuff for now. I needed a gap. But that gap should not be a waste of time. My mind was constantly getting attracted to the course \"Interactive Plots with Plotly and Dash\" but I was keeping it for later. Now, I knew, I needed to take this one. So, yeah it feels like it is a right choice."

    "The other thing that I want to share before starting all technical stuff is that, the course itself introduces to code in the IDE, but a goal like this to learn the plots with multiple independent / dependent parts, I need to sink through the code and try new things. And also after some time, when **YOU** come here to refresh the concepts, it should be clear as well. So I have chosen to code in JupyterLab becuse it provides the Markdown (my favourite stuff) and the code blocks. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is not a concept course, I mean not like other courses of ML and so which requires much explanation but still I have tried to devide the codes in seperate sections for a clear idea and easy easching."
